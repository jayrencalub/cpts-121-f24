* Programming Assignment: Programming Project 8 in Chapter 3            *
*                         of Hanly/Koffman book                         *
* Date:                                                                 *

* Description: This program calculates the cyclist's constant rate      *
*              of acceleration and determines how long it will take     *
*              for a cyclist to stop moving. The program displays the   *
*              rate of acceleration and amount of time it takes the     *
*              cyclist to stop moving.                                  *
*                                                                       *
* Relevant Formulas: a = (vf - vi) / t, where a is acceleration,        *
*                                       vi is initial velocity,         *
*                                       vf is final velocity,           *
*                                       t is time interval              *
