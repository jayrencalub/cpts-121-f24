* Programming Assignment: Programming Project 6 in Chapter 3                                 *
*                         of Hanly/Koffman book                                              *

* Description: This program calculates the speed of a runner for a mile                      *
*              in feet per second and meters per second. The program reads input             *
*              from a user. The input is the number of minutes and seconds                   *
*              that it took a runner to complete a mile. There are four entries              *
*              of times that need to be read, corresponding to four runners in the race.     *
*              The results of feet/sec and meters/sec calculations are displayed             *
*              to the screen.                                                                *
*                                                                                            *
* Relevant Formulas: 1 mile = 5,280 ft                                                       *
*                    1 km   = 3,282 ft                                                       *
